  about: {
    content: `I'm passionate about building clean and intuitive interfaces, while also having a solid understanding of scalable and stable system architecture.

I've worked on developing and operating serverless backends using Python and AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, etc.), solving real-world service issues in close collaboration with my team. I bring this experience into frontend development as well, approaching it from a user-centered perspective with an understanding of the entire system flow.

One of my greatest strengths is the ability to contribute flexibly not only to backend, but also to fronted or full-stack roles based on team needs and project goals.

I'm currently based in Melbourne, Australia, and available to work immediately under a Working Holiday visa. I'm looking forward to building meaningful services together through collaboration and shared purpose.`,
